Example scripts and Makefile for using `frock.php` to build PHP scripts from Clojure-flavoured source.

Do `make` to compile once.

Do `make watch` to watch-and-rebuild this folder on changes.

Do `make serve` to start a server, and then then visit <http://localhost:8000>.

You can also run individual builds with PHP on the command line: `php json.php`.
